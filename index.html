            <h1> The Story of the 10 Sons</h1>

            <p class="intro"> Once upon a time there lived a wise old fox deep in the woods among the ancient oak trees.
                Mr. Fox had 10 sons who spent their days making trouble, frolicking in the fields playing
                tricks on the other forest animals.

            <p>On one otherwise quiet afternoon, the 10 unruly fox brothers decided to play a game of hide- and-seek where they disguised themselves as 10 fiery hot suns, rising high
                above the Earth to shine on all below. With 10 suns in the sky, the forest grew very, very hot. The leaves became dry and brittle. 
                Acorns turned black and crumbled right down out of the trees. The soft forest floor was scorched and grew very hard.
                Mr.Fox was terribly upset with his sons. “Come down here right this instant!,” he called out to the 10 suns in the sky. But the 
                10 suns only laughed, “Ha, ha, ha!”

            <p>Mr. Fox was furious. He ran swiftly through the forest until he found his friend the porcupine. 
                “May I borrow 10 of your quills?” Mr. Fox asked, gasping for breath.
                “Of course,” the porcupine answered. “But whatever do you need them for? Shouldn’t you be hiding in your
                den to escape this awful heat instead of running around all out of breath?”
                “Well, that’s just the thing,” Mr. Fox replied. “My sons have disguised themselves as 10 fiery suns, and will not come down from 
                their perch high in the sky. But I have a plan to get them down.”
            </p>

                <img src="images\porcupin-loaded.jpg"  width="500" align="right" alt="badass porcupine with bow and arrow">
            </div>
            <p>
                Mr. Fox took the porcupine quills and ran as fast as he could, through the oak trees, over the winding river, through a golden 
                meadow and to the very top of Snowgood Mountain. He gathered some sticks and vines and whittled a large bent branch into a perfect bow.
                He took the first porcupine quill from his pocket, placed it on the string of the bow and woosh! He aimed the quill right at the first sun making it fall from the sky and back to Earth.
                He took the second quill and woosh! The quill went straight to the second sun making it fall from the sky back to Earth. 
                And he did the same for the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth suns.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mr. Fox reached in his pocket for the very last quill to shoot down the very last sun. But the porcupine quill was gone! “Oh no!
                I must have dropped it on my way here to Snowgood Mountain!”<br><br>

                As Mr. Fox sadly cried and his tears fell to the ground, the Queen Mother reached down from Heaven to console him. 
                “There, there,” she said.” “You have saved the Earth from nine of the scorching suns. We will make a deal with the one sun left in 
                the sky to rise and shine on Earth each day for a time called morning and to set and rest behind the mountains for a time 
                called evening. The sun agreed to the plan to save himself from being shot down back to Earth. But being that he was a trickster, 
                the Queen Mother wanted to keep a close watch on him. She decided to build her palace on the moon, the nearest place to Earth 
                on Heaven. And there she waits, with her white rabbit to make sure the sun keeps his end of the bargain.
                When the sun rises in the morning, the Queen Mother on the moon can rest. And when night falls,
                the Queen Mother and her rabbit keep watch over the night sky.<br><br>
                Mr. Fox and all of the forest animals cheered and clapped and danced when they realized the scorching suns were no more.
                Each year at harvest time, they gather acorns and nuts and berries and all of the bounties of their great harvests to offer the 
                Queen Mother and her white rabbit in the moon as a gesture of gratitude and goodwill.
                The End
